   ## Description 
   Every good project needs a quality README with information about the app - what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

## üíªusage
*Instructions and examples for use:*</br> When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.the application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README conditionally based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts (so, if you don't answer the optional questions, such as Installation, an Installation section will not be included in your README). The README will also include badges for your GitHub repo.
